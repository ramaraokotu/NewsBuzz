# NewsBuzz App ðŸ“±
The NewsBuzz app is designed using Jetpack Compose and adheres to Clean Architecture principles, specifically the MVVM pattern. It leverages Paging 3 for efficient data loading, Retrofit for seamless network operations, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, ensuring optimal performance and a modern development experience. The app's modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability.

## Features Implemented

- Display news in a list
- Display news details in webview

  ## Major Highlights
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern UI
- **MVVM architecture combined with Clean Architecture with modular structure** ensures a maintainability and scalability codebase.
- **Kotlin**
- **Dagger Hilt** for efficient dependency injection.
- **Retrofit** for seamless networking
- **Coroutines** for asynchronous programming
- **Unit tests** for robust code coverage
- **Navigation** for smooth transitions between screens

### Project Structure

#### Data Layer

The data layer holds the application data, including remote data sources. It depends on the domain layer to implement domain contracts. I wrote tests for the PagingSource in this layer.

#### Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the business logic, including repositories, models, and use cases. I wrote tests for the use cases in this layer.

#### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer contains the screens and their viewmodels. I followed the MVVM pattern here. I chose to use separate data models for the presentation layer rather than the domain models.

### Module Graph

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'neutral'
  }

graph LR
  :presentation --> :data
  :presentation --> :domain
  :app --> :data
  :app --> :domain
  :app --> :presentation
  :data --> :domain
```

Here's a breakdown of the module dependencies:
- `app` depends on `data`, `domain`, `presentation`.
- `presentation` depends on `domain`,`data`.
- `data` depends on `domain`.

### Testing
- I wrote tests for the `PagingSource` in the data layer.
- I wrote tests for the `usecases` in the domain layer.
- I wrote tests for the `viewmodels` in the presentation layer.
- I wrote tests for the UI in the presentation layer.
- I wrote some tests for navigation.
