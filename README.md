# NewsBuzz App ðŸ“±
The NewsBuzz app is designed using Jetpack Compose and adheres to Clean Architecture principles, specifically the MVVM pattern. It leverages Paging for efficient data loading, Retrofit for seamless network operations, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, ensuring optimal performance and a modern development experience. The app's modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability.

## Major Highlights

- **Jetpack Compose:** Utilizes modern UI design.
- **MVVM & Clean Architecture:** Ensures maintainable and scalable code with a modular structure.
- **Kotlin:** Programming language used.
- **Dagger Hilt:** Provides efficient dependency injection.
- **Retrofit:** Facilitates seamless network operations.
- **Coroutines:** Enables asynchronous programming.
- **Unit Tests:** Ensures robust code coverage.
- **Navigation:** Allows smooth transitions between screens.

## Features Implemented

- Display news in a list
- Display news details in webview

### Project Structure

#### Data Layer

Manages application data, including remote sources, and relies on the domain layer for contracts. Tests for the PagingSource are implemented here.

#### Domain Layer

Contains business logic, including repositories, models, and use cases. Tests for use cases are conducted in this layer.

#### Presentation Layer

Includes screens and their ViewModels, following the MVVM pattern. Uses separate data models for the presentation layer, distinct from domain models.

Here's a breakdown of the module dependencies:
- `app` depends on `data`, `domain`, `presentation`.
- `presentation` depends on `domain`,`data`.
- `data` depends on `domain`.

### Testing
- I wrote tests for the `PagingSource` in the data layer.
- I wrote tests for the `usecases` in the domain layer.
- I wrote tests for the `viewmodels` in the presentation layer.
- I wrote tests for the UI in the presentation layer.
- I wrote some tests for navigation.

### Dependency Use
